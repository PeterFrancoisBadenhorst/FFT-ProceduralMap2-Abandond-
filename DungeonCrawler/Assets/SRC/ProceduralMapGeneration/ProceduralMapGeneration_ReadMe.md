# BRD | Procedural Tile Based Map Generator | Phase 1

<b>Feature:</b> Procedurally generated tile-based map
Description: A map that is created by a set of rules rather than by hand. Each time the map is generated, it will be different.
Requirements:The map must be able to be generated in either 2D or 3D space.
The map must be able to be generated with a variety of different tile types.
The map must be able to be generated with a variety of different terrain types.

<b>Use cases:</b>The map can be used for a variety of different games, such as RPGs, strategy games, and puzzle games.
The map can be used for educational purposes, such as teaching geography or history.

<b>Benefits:</b>The map can be generated quickly and easily.
The map can be generated with a variety of different settings, making it suitable for a variety of different games and purposes.

## Technical Plan
<b>Overview:</b>The map will be generated using a procedural generation algorithm.
The algorithm will use a variety of different factors to determine the layout of the map, such as the size of the map, the type of terrain, and the distribution of resources.

<b>Implementation:</b>The algorithm will be implemented in C#.
The algorithm will use a variety of different data structures to store the map data.
The algorithm will use a variety of different algorithms to generate the map layout.

<b>Testing:</b>The algorithm will be tested by generating a variety of different maps.
The maps will be tested for correctness, performance, and usability.

<b>Deployment:</b>The algorithm will be deployed as a library that can be used by other developers.
The library will be available for free on GitHub.
