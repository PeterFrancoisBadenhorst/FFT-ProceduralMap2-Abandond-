# Method Name
AssignChunkTypes

# Description
Assigns a ChunkType to each GameObject in the input "grid" based on the types of its neighboring GameObjects.

# Parameters
grid (List of GameObjects): A list of GameObjects to be assigned ChunkTypes.
Returns
A List of GameObjects containing the input "grid" with updated ChunkTypes.

# Example Usage
```c#
List<GameObject> grid = new List<GameObject>();
// populate grid with GameObjects

List<GameObject> updatedGrid = AssignChunkTypes(grid);
```

# Implementation Details
Iterate through each GameObject in the "grid".
Get the "neighborStruct" field of the current GameObject's "ChunkBehavior" component.
Use the "FindChunkType" method to determine the ChunkType based on the types of its neighboring GameObjects.
Assign the resulting ChunkType to the "Direction" field of the "neighborStruct" field.
Return the modified "grid" List of GameObjects.
Note: The implementation of the "FindChunkType" method is not included in this code snippet. It is assumed to be implemented elsewhere.
