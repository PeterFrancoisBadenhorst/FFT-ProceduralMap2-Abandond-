# Method Name
FindChunkNeigbors

# Description
Finds the neighboring GameObjects for each GameObject in the input "grid" based on a given "scale".

# Parameters
scale (float): A scaling factor to determine the size of the neighboring region.
grid (List of GameObjects): A list of GameObjects whose neighbors are to be found.
Returns
A List of GameObjects containing the input "grid" with updated neighbor information.

# Example Usage
```C#
List<GameObject> grid = new List<GameObject>();
// populate grid with GameObjects
float scale = 1.5f;
List<GameObject> updatedGrid = FindChunkNeighbors(scale, grid);
```
# Implementation Details
Create an empty dictionary called "positions" that maps the position of each GameObject in the "grid" to the corresponding GameObject.
Create an instance of a class called "GenericUtilities".
Iterate through each GameObject in the "grid".
For each active GameObject, retrieve the neighboring positions using a method called "NeighborsPosition" from the "GenericUtilities" class.
If the current GameObject already has a component called "ChunkBehavior", retrieve it. Otherwise, add a new component of that type to the current GameObject.
For each neighboring position, check if there is a GameObject at that position in the "positions" dictionary. If there is, assign the corresponding GameObject to the appropriate neighbor field of the "ChunkBehavior" component of the current GameObject.
Set the "neighborStruct" field of each GameObject's "ChunkBehavior" component to the new neighbor information.
Return the modified "grid" List of GameObjects.
